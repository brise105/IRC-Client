Project name: IRC Client
Programmers: Brandon Briseno, Alfonso Castanos
Code Reviewer: Everett Yee

On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of __5__ based on the following criteria:

1  I was not able to compile the program due to insufficient information in the README.md file.

2  At least one of the programs has syntax errors and does not compile

3  The programs compile successfully but at least one generates runtime errors

4  The programs compile and run but the project does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results.
Specifically:

5  The programs compile and produce technically correct results but does not perform according to the documentation or does not comply with Chapman Coding Standards.
Specifically:

6  The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented, following the Chapman Coding Standards.

Suggestions for improving the code (for extra credit!): Adding a !help function that lists all the commands the bot can take would be nice.
Under that help command it could also display the parameters (if any) that the command takes, like how the README file currently
displays each command with "n" parameter.
